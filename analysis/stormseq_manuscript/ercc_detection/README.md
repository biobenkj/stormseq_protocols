# STORM-seq ERCC sensitivity analysis

Generally, we have known copy numbers of each of the spike-in species. 
For STORM-seq, we typically use a 1:1M dilution of the 92 ERCC spike-ins.
As a result, we can calculate sensitivity of STORM-seq to detect single
molecule species. 

The ERCC fasta file, GTF, and info are provided here for convenience.

The .rds objects for the STORM-seq data can be found at the zenodo link.
